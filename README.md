WaveBlocksND
============

Reusable building blocks for simulations with semiclassical wavepackets
for solving the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation.

Installation
============

Using Python's `virtualenv` for installation into a directory called `waveblocks`:

```Shell
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 --system-site-packages waveblocks
cd waveblocks
source ./bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/WaveBlocks/WaveBlocksND.git#egg=WaveBlocksND
```

Note: Python in version >= 3.4 is fully supported.
